## General Information

### About the Project

The project is a services listings platform where technicians and handiworkers can list their services and get hired. People looking for any of these services can search for a well rated seller and negotiate with them. People can search for the closest seller to their location if they need emergency services.

## Features to be implemented

-   The Application should be a single page application.
-   There should be a landing page that is the root URL.
-   The application should use [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for handling routing requests in the frontend.
-   There should be a dashboard for both sellers and buyers, and a seller can also be a buyer. A seller is anyone offering a service and a buyer is anyone receiving a service.
